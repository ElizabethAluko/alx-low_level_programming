# More functions and nesred loops
This project contains .c files of functions that performs specific tasks. The prototype of each of the functions are put in the header file main.h. The functions are tested with .c file main.c

## To compile the files

Use the following example as a guide:
```gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 0-main.c 0-isupper.c -o 0-isuper```

The above will generate an executable file 0-isuper
note: the header file must be in the same directory as other files.

## To execute the file:
run the following in your terminal.
```./0-isuper```
